A Node CLI tool that simplifies the process of setting up a new WordPress  
project and development environment.


## Dependencies

WP Project Manager depends on the following tools / programs. You'll need to  
have all of these installed in order for everything to work properly:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)  
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)  
[VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)


## Installation

Open up your preferred command line application and follow these commands:

```sh
# Move to the www folder in your VVV installation
cd /path/to/vvv/www

# Create your project folder
mkdir new-project-folder

# Switch to the new project folder
cd new-project-folder

# npm will complain if you don't have a package.json
npm init

# Install WP Project Manager
npm i https://github.com/Decisionary/wp-project-manager.git
```

## Usage

You can configure settings for your new project one of three ways:  

1. Create a `project.yml` file in your project folder or one of its parents.  
2. Add a new `wpProjectManager` key in your `package.json`.  
3. Specify individual settings via command arguments.  

You'll need to specify at least a project title using one of the above methods;  
the rest will be filled in automatically. Check the `project.yml` or  
`package.json` included in this repository to see all of the available options.  
The command arguments use dot notation and match the structure of the config  
files. For example, if you wanted to set a custom theme name, you'd use  
`--theme.name=`.

If you're using VVV with stock settings, the following would be the simplest way  
to get a new project up and running:  

```sh
cd /path/to/vvv/www/new-project-folder

wppm --project.title="My New Project"

cd ../..

# If the Vagrant box is already running:
vagrant provision

# If the Vagrant box is *not* already running:
vagrant up --provision
```

If you ran the above code, your dev URL would be `my-new-project.dev` and the  
theme folder would be located at `htdocs/web/app/themes/my-new-project`.

Note: if you need to import a production database into your development  
environment, you'll need to set the database prefix in your project config,  
or use the `--db.prefix` argument:

```sh
wppm --project.title="My New Project" --db.prefix="myprefix_"
```
